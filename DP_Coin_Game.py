# The coin game.
# This game is played between 2 players, player 1 and player 2. There are two piles of coins.
# The values of a coin can be any integer. Both players know the values of all coins in both
# piles. Player 1 makes the first move, and play alternates between the players. A move
# consists of taking a coin from the top of either of the piles (either player can take from
# either pile). The game ends when both piles are empty. A playerâ€™s score is the sum of the
# values of all the coins they took during the game. The player with the higher score wins.
